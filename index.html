  <p>Hi. My name is Varun Ved. <a href="http://twitter.com/vved123">@vved123.</a></p>

  <p><br></p>
  <p><i>Present:</i></p>

  <p>I'm a senior computer science student at CSU Sacramento. I transferred from community college in Fall 2015. I love all things tech, finance, cars, photography and sports.</p>

  <p>I currently work as a contractor at <a href="http://zillowgroup.com">Zillow Group</A>. I help work on the API team for our Premier Agent mobile product, I also spent last summer interning there.</p>
  <p>My other main project is <a href="http://datasciencecsus.com">Data Science @ Sac State</a>, where I am the founder and a current officer. Our goal is to bring together Sac State students who are interested in data science to learn more about different technologies and tools, and make some really cool projects.</p>
  
  <p>I'm also currently a Fellow at <a href="http://www.impactvc.com/">Impact Venture Capital</a>, a VC here in Sacramento. Our goal is to grow the tech scene within the region and invest in exciting companies that have real impact.</p>

  <p><i>Past:</i></p>

  <p>I previously co-founded AirQuail, startup changing the way we interact with air quality, we won $100k of funding from Lab360, but decided to not drop out of school to contine working on the startup.</p>

  <p>Previously I interned at <a href="http://www.lumobodytech.com">Lumo BodyTech</a> a wearable startup in Palo Alto, where I worked across the stack in testing and development. 

  <p>I've also interned at <a href="http://www.symsoftsolutions.com/">Symsoft Solutions</a>, doing software development and data mining, as well as <a href="http://signatacorp.com/">Signata Corp</a> doing software development and testing.</p>
  <p><br></p>

  <p><i>Independent Education:</i></p>
  <p>I'm a firm beliver that the best education happens outside the classroom. Becuase our school has little to no coursework in data science related classes, I've spent time taking machine learning courses online as well as diving into useful frameworks for data analysis such as numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, spark, postgreSQL, d3.js, R, and of course python.
